**Reseach Question:** How did anxiety and depression levels differ between states following the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States?

# Data Cleaning

Import libraries and dataset
```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

df = pd.read_csv("./Datasets/Indicators_of_Anxiety_or_Depression_Based_on_Reported_Frequency_of_Symptoms_During_Last_7_Days.csv")

df.head()
```

Filter to only state data and drop unnecessary columns;Group and Subgroup are redundant, Time period and CI are just combinations of other column's data.
```{python}
state_data = df[df['Group']=='By State']


state_data.drop(columns = ['Group', 'Subgroup', 'Time Period Label', 'Confidence Interval'], inplace = True)
```

Seperate Quartile Range into 2 Columns:
```{python}

```

Change Data Types as needed
```{python}
state_data['Indicator'] = pd.Categorical(state_data['Indicator'], categories = ['Symptoms of Depressive Disorder', 'Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder', 'Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder or Depressive Disorder'])

state_data['Time Period Start Date'] = pd.to_datetime(state_data['Time Period Start Date'])
state_data['Time Period End Date'] = pd.to_datetime(state_data['Time Period End Date'])
```
